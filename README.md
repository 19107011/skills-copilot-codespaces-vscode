### How to start this course

<!-- For start course, run in JavaScript:
'https://github.com/new?' + new URLSearchParams({
  template_owner: 'skills',
  template_name: 'copilot-codespaces-vscode',
  owner: '@me',
  name: 'skills-copilot-codespaces-vscode',
  description: 'My clone repository',
  visibility: 'public',
}).toString()
-->

1. Right-click **Start course** and open the link in a new tab.
2. In the new tab, most of the prompts will automatically fill in for you.
   - For owner, choose your personal account or an organization to host the repository.
   - We recommend creating a public repository, as private repositories will [use Actions minutes](https://docs.github.com/en/billing/managing-billing-for-github-actions/about-billing-for-github-actions).
   - Scroll down and click the **Create repository** button at the bottom of the form.
3. After your new repository is created, wait about 20 seconds, then refresh the page. Follow the step-by-step instructions in the new repository's README.

_Welcome to "Develop With AI Powered Code Suggestions Using GitHub Copilot and VS Code"! :heart:_

GitHub Copilot is an AI pair programmer that helps you write code faster and with less work. It extracts context from comments and code to suggest individual lines and whole functions instantly. GitHub Copilot is powered by OpenAI Codex, a generative pretrained language model created by OpenAI.

**Copilot works great with many code editors including VS Code, Visual Studio, JetBrains IDE, and Neovim.**

Additionally, GitHub Copilot is trained on all languages that appear in public repositories. For each language, the quality of suggestions you receive may depend on the volume and diversity of training data for that language.

Using Copilot inside a Codespace shows just how easy it is to get up and running with GitHub's suite of [Collaborative Coding](https://github.com/features#features-collaboration) tools.

> **Note**
> This skills exercise will focus on leveraging GitHub Codespace. It is recommended that you complete the GitHub skill, [Codespaces](https://github.com/skills/codespaces), before moving forward with this exercise.

### :keyboard: Activity: Enable Copilot inside a Codespace

**We recommend opening another browser tab to keep these instructions open for reference.**

Before you open up a codespace on a repository, you can create a development container and define specific extensions or configurations that will be used or installed in your codespace. Let's create this development container and add copilot to the list of extensions.

1. Navigating back to your **Code** tab of your repository, click the **Add file** drop-down button, and then click `Create new file`.
1. Type or paste the following in the empty text field prompt to name your file.
   ```
   .devcontainer/devcontainer.json
   ```
1. In the body of the new **.devcontainer/devcontainer.json** file, add the following content:
   ```jsonc
   {
       // Name this configuration
       "name": "Codespace for Skills!",
       "customizations": {
           "vscode": {
               "extensions": [
                   "GitHub.copilot"
               ]
           }
       }
   }
   ```
1. Click **Commit changes** and then select **Commit changes directly to the `main` branch**.
1. Create a codespace by clicking the **Code** button located in the middle of the page.
1. Click the **Codespaces** tab.
1. Click **Create codespace on main**.

   **Wait about 2 minutes for the codespace to spin itself up.**

1. Verify your codespace is running. The browser should contain a VS Code web-based editor and a terminal should be present such as the below:

1. The `GitHub.copilot` extension should show up in the VS Code extension list. Click the extensions sidebar and verify the extension is present such as the below:

**Wait about 60 seconds then refresh your repository landing page for the next step.**

_Nice work! :tada: You created a Codespace using a devcontainer file that included a GitHub Copilot extension._

GitHub Copilot provides suggestions for numerous languages and a wide variety of frameworks, but works especially well for Python, JavaScript, TypeScript, Ruby, Go, C# and C++. The following samples are in JavaScript, but other languages are supported.

Let's try this out utilizing Javascript for Copilot.

### :keyboard: Activity: Add a Javascript file and start writing code

1. From inside the codespace in the VS Code explorer window, create a new file. Note: If you closed the Codespace, please open it back up or create a new Codespace.
2. Name the file `skills.js`
3. Verify your new file looks like:
   ![Screen Shot 2023-03-09 at 9 21 34 AM](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/26442605/224105906-d1beb531-b747-4c7a-85ba-a12526488422.png)
4. In the `skills.js` file, type the following function header.
   ```javascript
   function calculateNumbers(var1, var2)
   ```
5. GitHub Copilot will automatically suggest an entire function body in grayed out text. Below is an example of what you'll most likely see, but the exact suggestion may vary.

6. Press `Tab` to accept the suggestion.

**Wait about 60 seconds then refresh your repository landing page for the next step.**

<summary><h2>Step 3: View the GitHub Copilot tab with multiple suggestions</h2></summary>

_Nice work! You just used AI code suggestions within a Javascript file by using GitHub Copilot :sparkles:_

Keep in mind that as you continue to use copilot, you may not want to always accept the first suggestion. You can use `Ctrl + Enter` to open the GitHub Copilot completions panel and view multiple suggestions.

### :keyboard: Activity: Pull up the suggestion dialog

1. From inside the codespace in the VS Code explorer window, create a new file. (If you closed the Codespace, please open it back up or create a new Codespace.)
2. Name the file `member.js`
3. In the `member.js` file, type the following function header.
   ```javascript
   function skillsMember()
   ```
4. Stop typing and hold `Ctrl + Enter` to view the GitHub Copilot completions panel.
5. Choose an appropriate function body from the suggestions (keep it simple!) by clicking on it.

**Wait about 60 seconds then refresh your repository landing page for the next step.**

_Nicely done utilizing the GitHub Copilot completions panel!_ :partying_face:

You now have leveraged the GitHub Copilot extension to provide AI generated suggestions. This extension is powerful, but you can supercharge this tool when you use comments to describe the intent of your code! Let's try it out!

### :keyboard: Activity: Use comments to generate code for the function

1. From inside the codespace in the VS Code explorer window, create a new file. (If you closed the Codespace, please open it back up or create a new Codespace.)
2. Name the file `comment.js`
3. Type the following comment.
   ```javascript
   // Function to generate a markdown list of skills from topics array
   ```
4. Press `Enter` to go to a new line.
5. GitHub Copilot will automatically suggest a function signature and file body with a return statement and everything. Here's an example of what you might see:

6. Press `Tab` to accept the suggestion.

**Wait about 60 seconds then refresh your repository landing page for the next step.**
